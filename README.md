# Stack Overflow Response Time Prediction
Predicting response time on posts from Stack Overflow using tag based features and ML algorithms

This approach attempts to improve on the ML model created by Goderie et al. You can find their paper at: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7180106

#Preparation: <br /> 
Data dump from StackExchange regarding both posts and tags from Stack Overflow are used to create the model. To get started, you will need to download the newest data dump from archive.org:
  * stackoverflow.com-Posts.7z: https://archive.org/download/stackexchange/stackoverflow.com-Posts.7z
  * stackoverflow.com-Tags.7z: https://archive.org/download/stackexchange/stackoverflow.com-Tags.7z
